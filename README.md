# AutoSchedule
My EC500 Project that generates a schedule based on when a user is busy and what they have to do.

Asks the user for if they want a day/week schedule, the date their schedule starts on, when they are busy, what they need to do. Then it runs it through an algorithm and places these events around when the user is busy. If the user wants they can log in through Google and add the schedule that was created to their Google Calendar
